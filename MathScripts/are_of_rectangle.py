# 2. How do you calculate the area of a rectangle #

#The formula for calculating area for a rectangle is Length * Width#

rectangle_side1 = 10 # The perimeter of a rectangle contains 4 sides, but for this problem 2 sides will equal 10 and the other 25 #
rectangle_side2 = 25


print("The area of the rectangle is number " + str(rectangle_side1 * rectangle_side2))
